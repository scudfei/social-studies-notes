# Lesson 1.2: Forces of Globalization

## Communication Technology

### Key Point:
> Computers and other new technology have revolutionized the way that information flows.

### Internet Usage Statistics

| Year | Canadian Internet Users | Global Internet Users |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|
| 2006 | 73% | 17% |
| 2024 | 94% | (not specified) |

### Impact:
- Dramatic increase in connectivity over less than 20 years
- Canada significantly ahead of global average
- Digital divide between developed and developing nations

## Media

### How Media Drives Globalization:
- **Online newspapers** - accessible globally
- **Access to newspapers** in other languages and from other countries
- **Satellite technology** allows the whole world to watch an event live (World Cup, news events...)
- **News organizations** can broadcast their programs around the world

## Media Concentration

### Definition:
> The gathering of ownership of newspapers and other media in the hands of few large corporations.

### Problems with Media Concentration:
- **Fewer diverse points of view**
- **Possible bias**
- **Profit-driven decisions**

## Media Convergence

### Definition:
> The use of electronic technology to integrate media such as newspapers, books, TV, and the internet all in one platform.

### Problems with Media Convergence:
- **Fewer journalists needed**
- **Fake news spreads faster**
- **Echo chambers** - people only see content that reinforces their existing views

## Critical Analysis

### Positive Impacts:
1. **Increased access** to information
2. **Global awareness** of events
3. **Cultural exchange** opportunities
4. **Educational resources** available worldwide

### Negative Impacts:
1. **Digital divide** between those with and without access
2. **Information overload**
3. **Loss of local media voices**
4. **Spread of misinformation**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Technology is the primary driver** - The internet and digital technology have fundamentally changed how we communicate globally

2. **Media plays a dual role** - It both connects us and creates new challenges

3. **Concentration vs. Diversity** - As media companies merge, we risk losing diverse perspectives

4. **Speed vs. Accuracy** - Information travels faster than ever, but this can compromise accuracy

5. **Access inequality** - Not everyone benefits equally from these technological advances
