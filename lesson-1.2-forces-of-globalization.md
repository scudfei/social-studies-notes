# Lesson 1.2: Forces of Globalization

## Communication Technology

### Key Point:
> Computers and other new technology have revolutionized the way that information flows.

### Internet Usage Statistics

| Year | Canadian Internet Users | Global Internet Users |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|
| 2006 | 73% | 17% |
| 2024 | 94% | (not specified) |

### Impact:
- Dramatic increase in connectivity over less than 20 years
- Canada significantly ahead of global average
- Digital divide between developed and developing nations

## Media

### How Media Drives Globalization:
- **Online newspapers** - accessible globally
- **Access to newspapers** in other languages and from other countries
- **Satellite technology** allows the whole world to watch an event live (World Cup, news events...)
- **News organizations** can broadcast their programs around the world

## Media Concentration

### Definition:
> The gathering of ownership of newspapers and other media in the hands of few large corporations.

### Problems with Media Concentration:
- **Fewer diverse points of view**
- **Possible bias**
- **Profit-driven decisions**

## Media Convergence

### Definition:
> The use of electronic technology to integrate media such as newspapers, books, TV, and the internet all in one platform.

### Problems with Media Convergence:
- **Fewer journalists needed**
- **Fake news spreads faster**
- **Echo chambers** - people only see content that reinforces their existing views

## Trade

### Why Countries Trade:
Trade allows countries to obtain goods and services which are:
- **Not available** in their own region
- **Better quality or less expensive**
- **Different from goods produced at home**

### Transnational/Multinational Corporations

**Definition:**
> Large companies that operate in more than one country (based in one country while developing and manufacturing its products/delivering its goods and services, in more than one country).

**Examples:** (Not specified in notes, but common examples include McDonald's, Apple, Nike, etc.)

### Supporters vs. Critics

**Supporters of transnational corporations say:**
- They grow the economy and bring products around the world
- Provide jobs to people around the world

**Critics say:**
1. Profits distributed unequally
2. They require little skill/power
3. Corporations have too much power
4. Bad for environment

### Which Countries Dominate?
- **Global North** countries dominate the transnational corporations

### McDonaldization
> "The process by which the principles of the _______ are coming to dominate more and more sectors of American society as well as the rest of the world"

## Transportation

### Evolution of Transportation
Transportation is essential for trade and has evolved through:
- People, camels, horses, carts
- Ships
- Trains
- Trucks
- Planes

**Key Point:** Today, products and people can move faster than ever before.

### Containerization

**Definition:**
> It means putting small things into a huge container.

**Importance to Globalization:**
> It is important due to its improvement of efficiency in global trade.

## Positive vs. Negative Aspects of Globalization

| Type | Positive Aspect | Negative Aspect |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Economic Globalization** | Countries can enjoy cheaper products (richer) | Certain countries can be exploited for cheap labour; ignores others |
| **Political Globalization** | Countries can work together to talk and try to avoid conflict | The majority view of countries may bully the minority |
| **Environmental Globalization** | The world can coordinate treaties about environmental protection more easily | More carbon emissions due to increasing international trade |
| **Social Globalization** | People can enjoy entertainment and art from other cultures | People's own culture gets weakened |

## The Global Village Concept

### Definition:
> The "global village" refers to how our world is getting smaller - not physically, but in terms of connections. The world is our own neighborhood now, becoming more interconnected by the transportation of messages and information faster than ever.

### Key Questions About the Global Village:

1. **What is the "global village"?**
   - Our own neighborhood is getting smaller
   - Recent events occurring in other parts of the world affect us locally
   - The world is getting smaller by the transportation of messages and information faster than ever

2. **What made this global village?**
   - Transportation improvements
   - Communication technology
   - International trade

3. **Relevance today:**
   - The concept of "disappearance of individual nations" is still debated

2. **Media plays a dual role** - It both connects us and creates new challenges

3. **Concentration vs. Diversity** - As media companies merge, we risk losing diverse perspectives

4. **Speed vs. Accuracy** - Information travels faster than ever, but this can compromise accuracy

5. **Access inequality** - Not everyone benefits equally from these technological advances

6. **Trade is fundamental** - Transnational corporations and improved transportation have reshaped the global economy

7. **The world is shrinking** - The "global village" concept captures how interconnected we've become
