## Important Concepts

### Patterns in Historical Globalization

1. **Cycles of Empire**
   - Rise, expansion, peak, and decline
   - Each empire builds on previous connections
   - Technology enables larger empires

2. **Trade as a Driver**
   - Silk Road connecting East and West
   - Maritime trade routes
   - Search for resources and markets

3. **Cultural Diffusion**
   - Spread of religions (Christianity, Islam, Buddhism)
   - Exchange of technologies
   - Language spread through conquest and trade

4. **Impact of Disease**
   - Plague along trade routes
   - Smallpox in the Americas
   - Disease as unintentional biological weapon

## Critical Thinking Questions

1. How did each empire contribute to globalization?
2. What were the costs and benefits of empire building?
3. How do historical patterns compare to modern globalization?
4. What role did technology play in each era?
5. How did trade routes facilitate cultural exchange?

## Key Terms

- **Imperialism:** Policy of extending power through colonization or military force
- **Mercantilism:** Economic theory that trade generates wealth; colonies exist to benefit mother country
- **Columbian Exchange:** Transfer of plants, animals, culture, technology, and diseases between Old and New Worlds after 1492
- **Silk Road:** Ancient network of trade routes connecting East Asia with Mediterranean world
- **Cultural Diffusion:** Spread of cultural beliefs, social activities, and items from one group to another

## Connections to Modern Globalization

### Historical Foundations of Today's World:
- Trade networks established centuries ago still influence modern commerce
- Colonial boundaries often became modern national borders
- Languages spread through empire (English, Spanish, French) dominate global communication
- Economic systems imposed during colonialism persist
- Cultural exchanges from historical globalization shape modern societies

### Lessons from History:
- Globalization has always created winners and losers
- Technology accelerates the pace of change
- Cultural identity often conflicts with global integration
- Economic motivations drive political decisions
- Unequal power relationships shape global systems
