# Lesson 1.4: Mercantilism and European Colonization

## Mercantilism

### Role of the Colonies

- Colonies supplied **cheap raw materials** like gold, silver, fur, lumber, and food
- Colonies were **not allowed** to trade with anyone else—only their "mother country"
- Purpose of colonies: to serve and enrich the **British** (the mother country)

### The Mother Country's Gain

Mother country made profits by:
- **Taking** resources from colonies
- **Selling** manufactured goods (like tools, clothing, weapons) back at **high prices**
- Colonies also had to pay high **taxes** on imports
- System was very **one-sided and unfair**

## Countries in the Race for Colonies

- **Spain**
- **Portugal**
- **France**
- **UK**

Later, these were joined by:
- **Germany**
- **Italy**
- **Japan**

## The Columbian Exchange / Grand Exchange

## Mercantilism: The Mother Country and her Colonies

**Definition:** Economic System used by **European countries** from **1500s to 1700s**

### A European View

The mercantilism system created a balance of trade that was **FAVORABLE** to the Mother Country:

**Key Economic Principle:**
- More **Exports** than **Imports** = Positive balance of trade
- Gold, Silver, Fur, Lumber, Food stuffs flow from Colonies to Mother Country
- Manufactured goods flow from Mother Country to Colonies

### Why are exports better than imports?
**Answer:** "Read the money" - more exports than imports brings wealth into the country

## Globalization Concepts Connection

This historical period demonstrates several dimensions of globalization:

| Globalization Concepts | Connection to Mercantilism |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Economic Dimension of Globalization | Trade of raw materials and manufactured goods |
| Political Dimension of Globalization | Colonial control and governance |
| Environmental Dimension of Globalization | Resource extraction and environmental impact |
| Social/Cultural Dimension of Globalization | Cultural exchange through colonization |
| Force of Globalization: Trade | Primary driver of colonial expansion |
| Force of Globalization: Transportation | Ships enabled global trade networks |
| Force of Globalization: Media and Communication Technology | Spread of European ideas and control |

*Note: Mercantilism was a one-sided economic system that enriched European powers at the expense of their colonies, setting patterns that would influence global economics for centuries.*
